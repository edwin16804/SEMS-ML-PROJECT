# SEMS-ML-PROJECT

Abstract—This project introduces a Smart Energy Management System (SEMS) that utilizes ensemble learning with AdaBoost and Random Forest classifiers to predict energy waste
in smart homes with high accuracy. It processes environmental data—brightness, humidity, and temperature—to identify un￾necessary lighting use. The system selects the most accurate
algorithm through comparative analysis, demonstrating significant potential in enhancing home energy efficiency. The results underscore the efficacy of SEMS in promoting sustainable energy
consumption and pave the way for future advancements in smart home energy optimization.
