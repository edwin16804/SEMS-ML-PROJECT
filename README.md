## Smart Energy Management System Using Ensemble Learning

### Project Overview
This project introduces a Smart Energy Management System (SEMS) that utilizes ensemble learning techniques, specifically AdaBoost and Random Forest classifiers, to predict and reduce energy wastage in smart homes. By processing environmental data such as brightness, humidity, and temperature, the system identifies unnecessary lighting use and optimizes energy consumption. The goal is to enhance energy efficiency in smart homes by implementing the most accurate predictive models.

### Objectives
- Develop a Smart Energy Management System (SEMS) to minimize energy wastage in smart homes.
- Utilize ensemble learning classifiers (AdaBoost and Random Forest) to predict energy waste with high accuracy.
- Compare the performance of these classifiers and select the best-performing model for deployment.

### System Architecture
1. **Data Collection Module**:
   - Utilizes Google Colab and Google Drive for computational resources and data access.
   - Collects raw sensory data from smart home sensors (brightness, humidity, temperature).

2. **Data Preprocessing Subsystem**:
   - Cleans and structures data, handles missing values, and performs feature extraction and engineering.
   
3. **Clustering Mechanism**:
   - Applies K-Means algorithm to segment the data into clusters, enhancing the feature set for the ensemble models.

4. **Ensemble Learning Engine**:
   - Integrates AdaBoost and Random Forest classifiers to predict energy wastage scenarios effectively.

5. **Performance Evaluation and Model Selection**:
   - Assesses model accuracy using metrics like accuracy score, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Selects the best-performing model for real-time decision-making.

6. **Decision-Making Module**:
   - Implements the selected model to predict energy wastage and control smart home devices.

7. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Continuously improves the system by retraining models with new data, ensuring adaptability and accuracy over time.
